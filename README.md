# CGES
Circular Greedy Equivalence Search (CGES) is a distributed structural learning algorithm for Bayesian Networks developed by Jorge Daniel Laborda, Pablo Torrijos, José M. Puerta and José A. Gámez.
This repository contains the code implementation of the algorithm described in the research article titled [A Ring-Based Distributed Algorithm for
Learning High-Dimensional Bayesian Networks]. The algorithm focuses on structural learning of Bayesian Networks in high-dimensional domains, aiming to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. The algorithm is limited to discrete problems.

## Introduction
In this research project, we propose an algorithm, named cGES, for learning Bayesian Networks in high-dimensional domains. The algorithm utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach, parallelism, and fusion techniques to address the challenges associated with structural learning in high-dimensional datasets. The code in this repository implements the cGES algorithm and provides a practical tool for researchers and practitioners interested in Bayesian Network learning.
